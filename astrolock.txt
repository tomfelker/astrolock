AstroLock
=========

Idea here is to make software to basically replace a telescope hand controller.  It should:

- be able to align a telescope mount given a few bright stars
	- known stars?  easy, but of course, gotta identify them...
	- unknown stars?  blah, just algorithms, just need to tune magnitude cutoff vs pointing accuracy
	- stretch goal: modeling arbitrary mount geometry (alt-az, equatorial, other random IK systems)
	- stretch goal: modeling physical errors in mounts?
- be able to point at things
	- fixed stars / galaxies / nebulae
	- planets, comets, asteroids, etc.
	- satellites, including tracking them
	- terrestrial objects (stretch goal: Google Maps integration, raytracing against world)
	- aircraft with ADS-B
	- birds
- nice real-time controls
	- using gamepads, keyboards, etc
	- direct slewing
	- tracking unknown moving objects (rocket launches, planes, new satellites, UFOs)
- support many telescope mounts
	- celestron, the one I have... which is able to move to commanded angles and rates
	- whatever else people add support for (with open source! none of this proprietary crap)
	- simulated stuff (stellarium?) for testing
- optical alignment (stretch goal)
	- take a picture with stars, plate solve, use that for alignment (don't even need to point at bright stars!)
	- webcam or phone + Dobsonian mount + voice commands (computer -> meat servo = win!)
- optical tracking (stretch goal)
	- grab frames in real time, find target, adjust rates to track = sweet ISS pictures
	
Software Dependencies
	- AstroPy
		- lots of framework for this sort of thing, in Python - coordinate systems, libararies, ephermerides, etc.
	- TensorFlow / NumPy - for computer vision stuff
	- TkInter - for UI prolly
	
	
	
Alignment Modes:
	- system aligned - the two axes we command are only assumed perpendicular, basically an AltAz mount on a tripod of arbitrary orientation
	- AltAz rough aligned - the two axes are altitude and azimuth, as though you turned on my telescope while it was level/north
	- Eq rough aligned - the two axes are R.A and Dec., as though you turned on an EQ telescope and it was aligned...
	
	
API Stuff
	- "Targets" as things which have paths...
		position (or direction? how to handle positions at infinity?) (in some coordinate system) as a function of time...
		
	- Tracking considered relative to this:
		- we remember an offset from the target path
			- in direction space?  e.g., degrees ahead, degrees above/below
			- 
	
UI Pages
	- Time
		- "current" time
		- system clock
			- hmm, any way to disable this from getting auto set by windows?
			- maybe can use the 
		- offset from system clock
			- auto set from GPS
			- enter here
		- GPS time last received and system clock time of that
		- system clock time at GPS last received
		- delay
	- Location
		- sync from GPS
		- set from Maps
		- go to map
	
	- Alignment
		- list of alignments:
			- mount coordinates, "unknown star" - what we'd need for 1, 2, 3 star aligns
			- mount coordinates + known object
			- mount coordinates + plate solve
			- checkboxes for whether to use
			- solution error
		- alignemt solution:
			- orientation of mount w.r.t earth centered earth fixed
			- with plate solving, also can get orientation (or at least roll) of camera wrt mount
			- parameters of mount sloppiness
	
		big buttons:
			- Align!  do the math
			- Add Point
				- unknown bright star
				- known star
				- plate solve
				- known map point (known elev?)

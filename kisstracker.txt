Tom's Crazy Ideas for a simple python script...

When turning it on, Altitude is zero, increasing as it moves upwards... and Azimuth is zero, probably normal convention...
and as documented, RA/DEC are some placeholder
and when trying to use stellarium, which is presumably issuing RA/DEC gotos, it just goes to its initial position

Then, after fake-aligning on Saturn, which was ~150 az, 25 alt...

z
Z
72c2,13b9

which means:

0xBLAH / 65536 * 360

161,27

so the documentation was kinda wrong, but the altaz is just as you'd expect... heading ccw from north, and up from horizon
so basically if you turn it on facing north and aligned with the index mark, hooray for you!
